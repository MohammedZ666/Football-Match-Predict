# Football Match Prediction with Deep Neural Network

* Scraped football teams' history of perfromance for past years.
* Trained a Deep Nerual Network on the past performance of the teams.
* Scraped live fixture from a website.
* Finally, predicted upcoming football matches via Deep Neural Network and the fixture.

# To run
I recommend to use google colab, since the fixture website might get blocked from your region.
